# End-to-End Bulk RNA-Seq Pipeline for CRC

This repository contains a complete, reproducible bioinformatics pipeline to process raw RNA-seq data from a colorectal cancer (CRC) project, quantify transcript expression, and perform downstream exploratory analysis using PySpark.

The workflow progresses from raw SRA files to a final plot comparing gene expression levels with transcript sequence features (GC content).

## Project Workflow

The analysis is divided into two main stages:

1.  **Command-Line Data Processing (WSL/Linux):** Raw sequencing reads are downloaded, cleaned of adapters and low-quality bases, and then quantified using Salmon.
2.  **Downstream Analysis (Jupyter Notebook):** The quantification results from all samples are loaded into a PySpark DataFrame, joined with sequence-level features, and analyzed to compare expression patterns between tumor and normal samples.

-----

## 1\. Requirements & Installation

This pipeline is designed to be run in a Conda environment within a Linux-based system (such as WSL on Windows).

**Conda Environment:** All required tools can be installed using the provided `environment.yml` file.

1.  **Create the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
2.  **Activate the environment before running any commands:**
    ```bash
    conda activate rnaseq
    ```

The `environment.yml` file should contain:

```yaml
name: rnaseq
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - pyspark
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - pyfastx
  - entrez-direct
  - sra-tools
  - trim-galore
  - salmon
  - parallel
```

**Reference Files:**

  * A **Salmon index** must be pre-built from a reference transcriptome (e.g., GENCODE).
  * The **reference transcriptome** in FASTA format is also required for the Python analysis.

## 2\. Usage

### Command-Line Processing

The following script, run from the project's root directory, will execute the entire data processing pipeline for the 10 samples from the `PRJNA413956` project.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure the conda environment is active
# conda activate rnaseq

echo "### Step 1: Fetching Sample IDs... ###"
esearch -db sra -query PRJNA413956 | efetch -format runinfo \
  | cut -d',' -f1 \
  | grep '^SRR' > prjna413956_srr_ids.txt

echo "### Step 2: Downloading SRA files in parallel (10 samples)... ###"
cat prjna413956_srr_ids.txt | parallel -j 4 'prefetch --verify no {}'

echo "### Step 3: Extracting and Trimming all samples... ###"
cat prjna413956_srr_ids.txt | while read SRR; do
  echo "--- Extracting $SRR ---"
  fastq-dump --split-files --gzip "$SRR"
  
  echo "--- Trimming $SRR ---"
  trim_galore --paired --fastqc --cores 4 "${SRR}_1.fastq.gz" "${SRR}_2.fastq.gz"
done

echo "### Step 4: Quantifying expression with Salmon... ###"
mkdir -p quants

for file in *_1_val_1.fq.gz; do
  SAMPLE=$(basename "${file}" _1_val_1.fq.gz)
  echo "--- Quantifying $SAMPLE ---"
  salmon quant -i ~/GENCODE/salmon_index_gencode_chr -l A \
         -1 "${file}" \
         -2 "${SAMPLE}_2_val_2.fq.gz" \
         --validateMappings -p 8 \
         -o "quants/${SAMPLE}_quant"
done

echo "### Pipeline Complete! ###"
```

### Downstream Analysis

After the command-line workflow is complete, open and run the `PRJNA413956.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to perform the final analysis and generate the plots.

## 3\. Output

  * **`quants/` directory:** Contains a subdirectory for each of the 10 samples. Each subdirectory holds a `quant.sf` file with the transcript-level expression data.
  * **`PRJNA413956.ipynb`:** The final notebook containing the PySpark analysis and visualizations. Key outputs include a PCA plot for quality control and a comparative plot of gene expression vs. GC content for tumor and normal samples.
